                <b>Cook 4 cups white rice.</b> Put the rice into boiling water and cook until cooked. 
                Some types of rice take about 10 minutes and other types of rice take up to 30 minutes 
                to cook. You can also cook rice in a microwave or rice cooker, it just won't taste as good.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Prepare vegetables.</b> First, wash 2 cups of carrots, 1 onion, 
                1 clove of garlic, one stick of ginger, and 1 cup of bean sprouts. 
                Then chop the carrots and onions, and grind 1 tablespoon of fresh ginger. 
                Set these ingredients aside.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p> 
                <b>Pour 2 tablespoons vegetable oil into a large frying pan.</b> 
                The frying pan you use must be deep enough, like a frying pan, use medium heat.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Cook the vegetables in the frying pan for 3 minutes.</b> 
                Add the carrots, onions, garlic and ginger to the frying pan. 
                Add 1 teaspoon of salt and a pinch of black pepper. 
                The vegetables will soften slightly but should not turn brown.

        <li>
            <p>
                </b>Put 1/4 kg of cooked chicken into the frying pan.</b> 
                You can use the chicken you cooked for another meal yesterday, 
                or buy chicken that is already cooked, or prepare special chicken to make fried rice first. 
                Dice the chicken thinly and add to the frying pan.
