    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sticky rice is a delicious preparation that can be found as a complement to various typical Asian dishes, most often in Thai or Indonesian main dishes. Sticky rice is also known as sweet rice or sticky rice. The sticky texture of this type of rice is obtained after cooking. Sticky rice is a common food and is usually eaten with hands. This article explains how to perfect it.</p>

    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>225 grams of Thai sticky rice: for the record, 225 grams of sticky rice is enough for 2 servings.</li>
        <li>250- 375 ml water</li>
        <li>Rice steamer</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p> <b>Prepare sticky rice.</b> 
                Determine the amount of rice in the pot or steamer. 
                If the amount of rice is more, don't forget to leave additional space for water, 
                125 to 250 ml of water per 225 grams of sticky rice.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p> <b>Wash the sticky rice if necessary</b> 
                Washing glutinous rice will remove the nutrients and starch components from the glutinous rice. 
                However, this process is optional due to the taste. To wash sticky rice, add water to the container 
                containing the rice, rub the rice, drain the milky white water,
                add new water, and repeat this process until the water is clear.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p> 
                <b>Soak sticky rice.</b> Add water to the container containing the sticky rice and soak for between 4 hours and overnight.
                The longer the rice is soaked, the stickier the texture becomes.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Steam the sticky rice. </b>
                Drain the rice water with a filter bowl. 
                Place a Thai bamboo rice basket or perforated wire container on top of the steamer pan to steam the sticky rice.
